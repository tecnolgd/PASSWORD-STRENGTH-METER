# PASSWORD STRENGTH METER

A basic CLI-based password strenght meter which gives the strength rating based on various basic password strength criterion.
Built to strengthen core programming concepts ‚Äî loops, conditions, and logic ‚Äî without any shortcuts or premature complexity.

#### (NOTE : The logic based on which this program works is not completely related to actual password strength testers, but it incorporates basic tests for determining the strength of the password, which may or may not match practical results.)

### Features‚öôÔ∏è:
- Logical-based
- Pure C- programming
- Basic practical features
- User-friendly
--------

##  Tech StacküöÄüöÄ

- C programming language 
- Console-based UI
- logic-building
--------

### Concepts practicedü™õ:
- conditional statements
- interation using loops(while,for)
- indentation
--------

### Future upgradesüõ∞Ô∏è:
