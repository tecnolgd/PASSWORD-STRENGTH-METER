# PASSWORD STRENGTH METER

A basic CLI-based password strenght meter which gives the strength rating based on various basic password strength criterion.
Built to strengthen core programming concepts — loops, conditions, and logic — without any shortcuts or premature complexity.

#### (NOTE : The logic based on which this program works is not completely related to actual password strength testers, but it incorporates basic tests for determining the strength of the password, which may or may not match practical results.)

## Features⚙️:
- Logical-based
- Pure **C- programming**
- Basic practical features
- User-friendly

##  Tech Stack🚀🚀
- C programming language 
- Console-based UI
- logic-building

## Concepts practiced🪛:
- Conditional statements
- Interation using **loops**(while, for)
- Indentation

## Future upgrades🛰️:
- Improve range and complexity logic of password testing
- Add practical criteria 
- Link to real-time password strength trends
- Feedback system for improvement

## How to Run🔛 ?
1) Open the terminal.
2) Compile the file using any C compiler:
```bash
gcc main.c -o main && main //for windows 
```
## Sample output:

## Note:*For clear screen in the output,append the code with*
```c
system("cls"); //for WINDOWS OS
system("clear"); //for MAC/LINUX OS
```
